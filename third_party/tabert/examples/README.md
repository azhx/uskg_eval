# Example Applications using TaBERT

In our paper, we applied TaBERT as representation learning layers for semantic parsing over database tables. Specifically, we experimented on the WikiTableQuestions and the Spider benchmark, by replacing the encoders of existing systems operating on the two datasets with our TaBERT model:
