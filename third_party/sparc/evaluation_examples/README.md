# Evaluation

This directory includes some example gold, predicted, and evaluation result files:

- `gold.txt`: a sample gold file where each line is `gold SQL \t db_id`, and each interaction is splitted by a new empty line.
- `predict.txt`: the sample predicted file where each line is a predicted SQL
- `eval_output.txt`: the sample evaluation result file

More details on SQL evaluation can be found on [the Spider Github page](https://github.com/taoyds/spider/tree/master/evaluation_examples).
